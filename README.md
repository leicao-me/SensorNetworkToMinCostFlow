# SensorNetworkToMinCostFlow
Research Project for CSC500 Research Method - CSUDH

This is a tentative commit. A code cleaning will be done later.

How to run:

1. Compile
$ javac *.java

2. Run
$ java SensorNetwork

All the inputs now is hard coded. It will change to take user input later.

Reference:
The project is a modification on a Sensor Network Generator Program is provided by Professor Bin Tang. The modification is to add a conversion algorithm to convert the generated sensor network to an input of minimum cost flow algorithm - cs2-4.6
